## about Windows shortcut key
ctrl + s or ctrl + q commnad is used stty command in terminal.  
As I will use those shortcut key(*1), I disable those command; stty start / stop undef

To become a device error when you run an invalid stty in bash_login, it must be executed in bashrc


*1:
- ctrl + s -> overwritten shortcut  
- ctrl + q -> another vim's rect selection  
            [ctrl + v] of that original command is used to paste shortcut
